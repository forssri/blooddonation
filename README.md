Rufus+ aims to change the workflow of Blood/Platelet donation. It is a free and open source portal.

# Current flow

 - Calls/Messages donors to check availability
 - Lot of manual effort needed

# What are we trying
 - Donor registers in Rufus+ by choosing the area where they can donate
 - Patient/Attender creates a request for blood/platelet by choosing location
 - Every donor who matches the donation criteria and location gets a push notification
 - Donor responds to the request
 - Real time tracking of how many donors have acknowledged

# Technology
